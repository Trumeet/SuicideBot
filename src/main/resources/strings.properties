welcome = Hi, there. I'm the Suicide bot which lets you block yourself in groups for a random time, lol. Just for fun and I'm not responsible for anything caused. To start using, add me to any groups and grant me "Block user" permission.

fail_is_creator = You are the god (creator) of the group so you can't do that :(
fail_missing_permission = `Block user` permission is not generated, ask the admin of this group for help
fail_is_administrator = You are an admin of the group, why would you like to do that? :D
fail_not_group = You can only do that in a group.

done = Congratulations! You are blocked for `%d` seconds (random value, min: 30s, max: 1day). Enjoy your offline time!
